                            day in day out; this is my testimony. <br> <br>I started taking the full range of products around a year after my fourth surgery. Sick of the aching and swelling that lingered in my body I was willing to try anything. After
                            8 months of convincing from my sister in law I finally decided to say yes to a 30 day trial.<br><br>Two weeks in and I started to see incredible results; it was the first time since I was 14 that I had woken up being able to
                            feel and see my knee caps with no swelling. Little did I know this was just the start of some great results; my sleep had drastically improved with great focus and energy each day. The products had helped cut out my snacking
                            of bad foods throughout the work day and blew my performances in Personal Training sessions out of the water! Not to mention the recovery, hard sessions with being able to wake up the next morning feeling fresh and ready to
                            go again.&nbsp;<br><br>A lot of people do not realise the topical benefits of the products either; with my bruising from high contact sports disappearing in 1-2 days verses a week to 2 weeks and the clearing of blocked sinuses
                            and ear aches, to the healing of cuts/burns! I cannot rate these products high enough, I live and breathe them! They have enabled my body to go back to playing the sports that I love!<br></p>

                            and C3 in my neck lead to nerve damage, causing reduced use of my right arm/hand, limited movement in turning my head and inflammation. I was on anti-inflammatories, pain killers and seeing a physio 2-3 times a week and doing
                            Iyenga yoga once a week for pain management. I had cortisone injections, dry needling and acupuncture among other procedures with minimal if any relief.<br><br>2.5 years later I was introduced to Kyani. Expecting increased
                            energy levels - being a Mum of 5 kids and running a business, I was surprised to find that within a few short weeks I had forgotten to take my pain meds and anti-inflammatories, I hadn’t taken them for 2 weeks as the pain was
                            too minimal to prompt me. Soon after, I was no longer requiring my regular physio appointment and have not been back to my sessions or on the meds or anti-inflammatories since.<br><br>I found I was no longer napping on the
                            couch, I had the endurance to last the day until late at night, yet fell asleep easily and slept well, despite being woken during the night by our baby, I felt well rested when I woke up. I have a better quality of life thanks
